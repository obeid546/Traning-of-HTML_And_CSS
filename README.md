# Traning-of-HTML_And_CSS

1- CatPhotoApp is a project I finished with freecodecamp.com in an HTML tutorial. It's based on HTML and nothing else, explaining the basic concepts of it.

2- Cafe Menu is a web page that contains some info about coffee and desserts which is bought there, with simple HTML and CSS code, for training and refreshing my coding skills.

3- Registration From is a web form that collects data from various users, I created it through my journey with HTML & CSS.
